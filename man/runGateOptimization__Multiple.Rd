\usage{
runGateOptimization__Multiple(
  opt_object,
  start_points,
  n_cores = 1,
  optimization_method = "PSO-LBFGSB",
  output_directory_name = NULL,
  optimization_control = list()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{opt_object}{An optimization task object as created by \code{initiateOptimizationTask}.
Must include a valid population sample, search space definition, and PKPD model.}

\item{start_points}{Data frame of starting points, where each row corresponds to a named
treatment parameter vector used as \code{starting_point} input to \code{runGateOptimization}.
Columns are matched and reordered to \code{rownames(opt_object[['searchSpace']])}.}

\item{n_cores}{Integer. Number of CPU cores to use for parallel execution. If greater than 1,
runs are distributed using \code{parallel::mclapply}. Default is 1.}

\item{optimization_method}{Character. Name of the optimization algorithm to use for each run
(passed to \code{runGateOptimization}). Default is \code{"PSO-LBFGSB"}.}

\item{output_directory_name}{Character or NULL. Name of the subdirectory within
\code{opt_object[['WorkDirectory']]} where outputs will be written. If provided, the directory
is created if it does not exist.}

\item{optimization_control}{Named list of control parameters for the selected optimization
method (passed to \code{runGateOptimization}).}
}
\value{
The (unchanged) \code{opt_object}. Results are produced as side effects (files written
to disk); each run returns its optimization output internally but is not propagated by this
wrapper function.
}
\description{
Executes gate optimization for a set of candidate starting points (separate runs).
Each row of dataframe \code{start_points} is treated as a distinct starting-point vector and is passed
to \code{runGateOptimization}. Runs can be executed sequentially or in parallel (via
\code{parallel::mclapply}) depending on the number of available cores.
}
\details{
The function creates an output directory (if needed), writes the starting points to file,
and assigns a dedicated output filename to each optimization run.
