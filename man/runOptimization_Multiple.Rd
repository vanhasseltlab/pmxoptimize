\usage{
runOptimization_Multiple(
  opt_object,
  optimization_methods_agenda,
  kurtosis = 50,
  verbose_level = 3,
  n_cores = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{opt_object}{An optimization task object as created by \code{initiateOptimizationTask}. Must include a valid population sample.}

\item{optimization_methods_agenda}{A list of optimization method configurations. Each element must be a named list with:
\describe{
\item{\code{method}}{A character string specifying the optimization method (e.g., \code{"PSO-LBFGSB"}, \code{"GA"}, \code{"BFGS"}).}
\item{\code{control}}{A named list of control parameters specific to the method. See \code{runOptimization()} for details.}
}}

\item{kurtosis}{Numeric. A penalty tuning parameter passed to the objective function. Represents the kurtosis parameter in a logistic function. Default is 50.}

\item{verbose_level}{Integer (0–3). Level of verbosity during optimization. Default is 3.}

\item{n_cores}{Integer. Number of CPU cores to use for parallel simulation. If \code{n_cores > 1}, uses \code{mclapply()} for parallel execution. Default is 1 (sequential).}
}
\value{
The updated \code{opt_object} after running all specified optimization methods.
}
\description{
Executes multiple optimization runs sequentially or in parallel, based on a predefined agenda.
Each optimization method and its control settings are specified in the \code{optimization_agenda}.
Results are stored in the project object and saved to disk after all runs complete.
}
