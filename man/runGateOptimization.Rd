\usage{
runGateOptimization(
  opt_object,
  starting_point,
  optimization_method = "PSO",
  optimization_control = list(),
  return_optimization = F,
  verbose_level = 2,
  output_filename = NULL,
  save_optimization = T,
  multiple = F
)
}
\arguments{
\item{opt_object}{An optimization task object as created by \code{initiateOptimizationTask}.
Must include a valid population sample, search space definition, and PKPD model.}

\item{starting_point}{Named numeric vector defining the initial treatment parameter values
used to initialize and gate the optimization search.}

\item{optimization_method}{Character. Name of the optimization algorithm to use.
Supported methods are the same as for \code{runOptimization}, with \code{"PSO"}
recommended for gated optimization.}

\item{optimization_control}{Named list of control parameters specific to the selected
optimization method.}

\item{return_optimization}{Logical. If TRUE, the optimization result is returned together
with the starting point. If FALSE, the updated \code{opt_object} is returned. Default is FALSE.}

\item{verbose_level}{Integer (0–3). Controls verbosity during optimization.
Higher values provide more detailed console output.}

\item{output_filename}{Character or NULL. Optional filename to which optimization history
or results may be written.}

\item{save_optimization}{Logical. If TRUE, the optimization results and updated object
are saved to disk. Default is TRUE.}

\item{multiple}{Logical. If TRUE, suppresses console messages for batch execution of
multiple gate optimizations. Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
If \code{return_optimization = FALSE}, the updated \code{opt_object} is returned.
If TRUE, a named vector combining the starting point and optimization result is returned.
}
\description{
Executes a gated model-based optimization starting from a pre-selected treatment parameter set.
The continuous-point objective value is used as a gate reference to identify optimized parameter
sets with penalty values that are better than or equal to the starting-point penalty.
